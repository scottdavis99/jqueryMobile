		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			jQuery.js is literally the most popular JavaScript library of all time -- it is used in more than 50% of the top 10,000 websites. But don't get tricked into thinking that jQuery Mobile is simply a smartphone- and tablet-optimized version of the library. It isn't. (That's Zepto.js, by the way...) jQuery Mobile is a web framework targeted at developing client-side MVC applications, much like Grails, Rails, Struts, and SpringMVC are web frameworks targeted at developing server-side MVC applications.

		<p>
			In this session, you'll learn how jQuery Mobile makes it easy to define pages, forms, lists, buttons, and all sorts of finger-friendly widgets. But more importantly, you'll see how jQuery enables you to write a single HTML5 app that runs equally well on iPhones, Android phones, Kindle Fires, iPads, and all manner of other tablets and smartphones.
